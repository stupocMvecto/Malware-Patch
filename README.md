Mani Ratnam was born on 2 June 1956 in Madurai, Tamil Nadu as the second child of a Tamil Brahmin family that was closely associated with film production.[4][5][6] His father, S. Gopalaratnam, was a film distributor who worked for Venus Pictures,[7] while his uncle, "Venus" Krishnamurthy, was a film producer. His elder brother, G. Venkateswaran, would go on to produce some of his films.[7][8][9] His younger brother was G. Srinivasan, who like G. Venkateswaran, would also co-produce some of his films.[10] Mani Ratnam grew up in Madras (now Chennai),[11] along with his siblings and cousins. Despite being a film family, the children were not allowed to watch films as the elders considered them taboo.[12] "As a youngster, films seemed like a waste of time", he claimed in a 1994 interview;[5] however, he started watching films more actively when he was studying at the Besant Theosophical School.[12] During this time, he developed an admiration for actors like Sivaji Ganesan and Nagesh; watching all their films. When he discovered the legendary director K. Balachander, he became his fan. Upon completing his schooling, he graduated with a degree in commerce from the Ramakrishna Mission Vivekananda College, affiliated to the Madras University. Later, he did his Master of Business Administration (MBA) in finance from Jamnalal Bajaj Institute of Management Studies in Mumbai.[8] After finishing his post-graduation in 1977, he was employed in a firm in Madras as a management consultant, and continued to work there for sometime.[8]
 
In 1995, Mani Ratnam was wounded and hospitalised after homemade bombs were thrown at his home by attackers, suspected by police as Muslim extremists, in the wake of opposition to his film Bombay which portrayed the romance of a Hindu man with a Muslim woman.[17]

An FIR was filed on Mani Ratnam and 49 others in 2019 when they wrote to Modi listing statistics and expressing concern over the rise of communal violence against minorities including Muslims, Christians and Dalits since Modi's Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) took power in 2014.[18][19]
 
Mani Ratnam was not satisfied with his job as a consultant as he found it to be a mere extension of his academics. During this time his friend Ravi Shankar, son of director B. R. Panthulu, was in the process of making his first film. Mani Ratnam, Ravi Shankar and another friend Raman, son of filmmaker S. Balachander, worked on the script of the film.[12] Mani Ratnam took a sabbatical from his job to ensure his participation in the making of the film. Being inexperienced, the makers were largely dependent upon the *American Cinematographer* magazine. The principal cast included Vishnuvardhan, Srinath, Ambareesh, Lakshmi, and Roja Ramani. When the filming was about to begin in Kolar, Karnataka, Mani Ratnam left his consulting job and joined the crew. The film, however, did not take off and was eventually shelved. Nevertheless, he was firm in his idea of becoming a film-maker. Although not impressed with many of the films made in Tamil cinema, he was "amazed" at Bharathiraja's *16 Vayathinile* (1977), K. Balachander's *Apoorva Raagangal* (1975), and Mahendran's *Mullum Malarum* (1978) and *Uthiripookkal* (1979). During this time, he befriended a group of people namely P. C. Sreeram, Santhana Bharathi, and P. Vasu, who shared his interest of entering into the film industry.[12]
 
In 1986, Mani directed the Tamil romantic drama *Mouna Ragam*, which starred Revathi and Mohan. The film was critically acclaimed for portraying urban Tamils in a "realistic" manner.[24] Specifically, it told the story of the friction between a newly-wed couple.[21] The score by Ilaiyaraaja was appreciated along with SPB in back ground score and became popular upon release.[25] *Mouna Raagam* was subsequently dubbed into Telugu under the same title and became a hit in Andhra Pradesh as well.[26] The film elevated Mani's status as a director, and won the National Film Award for Best Feature Film in Tamil at the 34th National Film Awards. He won his first Filmfare Award for directing the film.[21][27]
 
Following these two commercial successes, Mani wrote and directed Agni Natchathiram in 1988.[37] The film deals with the story of step-brothers played by Prabhu and Karthik[25] and is notable for its use of new techniques in camera framework, especially during the songs.[38] The film had a successful run in the box office.[8][37]
 
In 1989, Telugu actor Nagarjuna and Mani Ratnam collaborated for a Telugu film and it remains the only Telugu film directed by Ratnam.[39] The film *Geethanjali* which had Nagarjuna and Girija Shettar in the lead, told the story of an ill-fated couple, both of whom are suffering from terminal diseases.[8] *Geethanjali* was critically acclaimed and won the National Film Award for Best Popular Film Providing Wholesome Entertainment in 1990. In addition, it won the Best Director and Nandi Award for Best Story Writer for Mani.[40] Mani maintained a momentum of making emotional stories of under-served people through the film *Anjali* in 1990, which starred Baby Shamili as the central character. The film which also had Raghuvaran and Revathy, told the story of an autistic child who changed the lives of people around her.[41] The film proved to be a commercial success and was nominated as India's official entry to the Oscars in the Best Foreign Language Film category at the 63rd Academy Awards.[41][42] Following *Anjali's* release, Mani later made another underworld-themed Tamil film, *Thalapathi* (1991), starring Rajinikanth and Mammootty.[43] The film was loosely based on Mahabharata, dealt with the friendship between Karna and Duryodhana portrayed by Rajinikanth and Mammmooty respectively.[25][44] The film met with both critical acclaim and commercial success upon release.[45] Ilaiyaraaja's musical score and Mani's work were highly appreciated as they both went on to win the Music Director and Best Director awards respectively at the 39th Filmfare Awards.[46]
 
Mani again teamed up with Ram Gopal Varma to provide the screenplay for the latter's Telugu film *Gaayam*, a socio-politico film loosely based on *The Godfather*.[52] In 1995, Mani returned to Tamil language drama through *Bombay* starring Arvind Swamy and Manisha Koirala, which told the story of a Hindu-Muslim couple in the midst of the 1993 religious Bombay riots and bombings. It was also the first Indian film to focus on marriage between Hindu and Muslim people.[53] The film met with controversy and censorship upon release.[53] It was subsequently dubbed into Hindi where it gained commercial success and appreciation by critics.[53] It won a number of awards, such as Nargis Dutt Award for Best Feature Film on National Integration, Political Film Society Awards|Special Award from the Political Film Society,[54] In the Spirit of Freedom Award at the Jerusalem International Film Festival[55] and the Gala Award at the Edinburgh International Film Festival.[56]
 
Mani produced his wife's directorial debut film, *Indira*,[57] and then directed the critically successful *Iruvar* with Mohanlal, Aishwarya Rai, Tabu and Prakash Raj in the lead. *Iruvar* was awarded the Best Film at the "Festival of the Auteur Films" at the FEST film festival held in Belgrade.[58] In 1998 came the third part of his "terrorism trilogy", named *Dil Se..* and starring Shahrukh Khan and Manisha Koirala, with the latter fabricating the second collaboration.[59] It showed the relationship between a young man and a dangerous, disturbed woman. Although they fall in love, she is unable to take the romance further due to her bleak past. The soundtrack album, again composed by A. R. Rahman, gained mass appeal and gave Rahman his next Filmfare Award for Best Music Direction in 1999.[60][61] Unlike his previous two projects, *Dil Se..* opened with little note among film critics and performed poorly in the domestic market,[62] despite being a success overseas.[63][64][65] It was screened in many international film festivals, and won the Netpac award (Ex-Aqueo) in the Berlin International Film Festival.[66] The film over the years has achieved cult classic status.[67][68]
